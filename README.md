<h1>Special Orders - Abundance Food Co-op, Rochester NY</h1>

### Note for myself

To run the app, use the following commands:

```bash
npm run dev
# This will run the "dev" script in package.json, that runs the webpack build in watch mode
# The webpack build will watch for changes in the javascript code and recompile it automatically
```

and in another terminal:

```bash
python3 manage.py runserver
# This will run the Django server with an updated version of the javascript code
```

If needed, clear the browser cache to see the changes.
